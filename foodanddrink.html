		<h2>Restaurants</h2>
		<p class="p">Did you know that there&rsquo;s a restaurant in Taiwan that serves all-you-can-eat hot pot and another one that serves all-you-can-drink bubble tea&quest; Well&#44; judging by the look on your face&#44; you didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been to both of these restaurants multiple times&#44; and I can say with certainty that these will be the best restaurants you EVER go to&excl; Not only is there an all-you-can-eat hot pot for one of the restaurants &#40which is an automatic yes&#41;&#44; there&rsquo;s also ICE CREAM for dessert&#44; which means you&rsquo;ll be able to kill two birds with one stone&excl; The other restaurant has an all-you-can-drink bubble tea&#44; and the menu is filled with all sorts of types of noodles. My favourite is the beef noodle soup&#44; but you can pick whatever you want&#44; because it&rsquo;s not the meal that&rsquo;s important&#44; it&rsquo;s the BUBBLE TEA&excl;</p>-
		<h2>Groceries</h2>
		<p class="p">Of course&#44; there&rsquo;s your typical supermarket in Taiwan&#44; but there are also supermarkets that are set in specific streets. Along some alleys&#44; you can find a trail of shops or stands that sell a variety of different items&#44; ranging from fruits to clothing. These supermarkets are similar to the night markets&#44; but they&rsquo;re open in the day&#44; and most of them sell groceries instead of fast food. </p>
		<h2>Night Market</h2>
		<p class="p">You&rsquo;ve probably never been to a night market before&#44; but let me tell you&#44; they are AMAZING&excl; These markets are open at night&#44; and most of them sell snacks&#44; fast food&#44; clothing&#44; and bubble tea. The environment is usually pretty loud and crowded&#44; but that&rsquo;s part of the reason why I like it so much. You can walk around while eating and exploring the area of the night market because they&rsquo;re only open during the night.</p>
