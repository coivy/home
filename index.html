		<p class="center" id="paragraph">I know&#44; you&rsquo;re probably thinking&#44; &ldquo;Why should I let my child go halfway across the globe for a fun vacation&quest;&rdquo; First of all&#44; I&rsquo;m hardly a child anymore &#40;almost 15&#33;&#41;. Also&#44; according to Google&#44; the most trusted source in the world&#58; Taiwan is a QUARTER of the distance around the globe from Canada. The only thing you got right was the fun vacation part&#44; but even that&rsquo;s an understatement. Taiwan is THE BEST vacation destination&#44; plus&#44; I&rsquo;ve already thought of every single positive of going&#58;
		<ol class="center">
			<li> IT&rsquo;S CHEAP&#33; &#40;Isn&rsquo;t that the first thing you look for&quest;&#41;
				<p class="justify">Despite being a quarter of the way across the globe&#44; it&rsquo;s fairly cheap to fly to Taiwan&#44; only &#36;851 for a round-trip. And if that&rsquo;s not enough&#44; I&rsquo;ve got all the details about the <a href="#prices">prices</a> also on this webpage&excl; </p>
			</li>
			<li> Shelter
				<p class="justify">I know you&rsquo;re extremely concerned about where I would live during the 2-month vacation&#44; so I&rsquo;ve also got that covered&excl; For the most part&#44; I&rsquo;ll be living in our house in Taiwan&#44; and for the rest&#44; I&rsquo;ll live in cheap hotels.</p>
			</li>
			<li> DELICIOUS &#40;and slightly healthy&#41; FOOD&excl;
				<p class="justify">Taiwan&rsquo;s food and drinks are THE BEST&#44; with a wide range of food&#44; like bubble tea and pork intestine noodles&#44; which sounds nasty but is amazing &#40;I speak from personal experience&#41;. Additionally&#44; I could always go for a homemade meal every once in a while to maintain health.
			</li>
			<li> E N J O Y A B L E
				<p class="justify"> Of course&#44; this is the least of your priorities&#44; but I couldn&rsquo;t go on without talking about all of the attractions Taiwan has to offer&#58; epic views&#44; amusement parks&#44; TRAMPOLINE PARKS&#44; and your personal favourite&#44; museums&excl; On top of that&#44; Taiwan is close to neighbouring countries like Korea&#44; and I can take guided trips there for a cheaper price&excl;

		<p class="texts"> So&#44; I know that you&rsquo;re too excited to look at the expenses of my trip&#44; so I&rsquo;ve got them here at this table so that even mere mortals like you can understand it&excl; I&rsquo;ve also got a link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lj2f6NwbQ4R4Hfp7n9cKaB1JI9Co4WknOp68w3VNLUc/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
